blur()
A CSS <length>. Applies a Gaussian blur to the drawing. It defines the value of the standard deviation to the Gaussian function, i.e., how many pixels on the screen blend into each other; thus, a larger value will create more blur. A value of 0 leaves the input unchanged.

brightness()
A CSS <percentage>. Applies a linear multiplier to the drawing, making it appear brighter or darker. A value under 100% darkens the image, while a value over 100% brightens it. A value of 0% will create an image that is completely black, while a value of 100% leaves the input unchanged.

drop-shadow()
Applies a drop shadow effect to the drawing. A drop shadow is effectively a blurred, offset version of the drawing's alpha mask drawn in a particular color, composited below the drawing. This function takes up to five arguments:
<offset-x>: See <length> for possible units. Specifies the horizontal distance of the shadow.
<offset-y>: See <length> for possible units. Specifies the vertical distance of the shadow.
<blur-radius>: The larger this value, the bigger the blur, so the shadow becomes bigger and lighter. Negative values are not allowed.
<color>: See <color> values for possible keywords and notations.
